## What this mod does
* When the game starts, it changes all "motorized" and "controllable" vehicles on the map to default settings: wheel drive mode to "all-wheel (4WD)" and deactivation of both differentials.
* On HUD it displays:
  * Damage values in % for controlled vehicle and all its attachments.
  * Fuel fill level for Diesel/AdBlue/Electric/Methane and the current fuel usage rate<sup>1</sup>.
  * The current status of the differential locks and wheel drive mode.
  * The current engine RPM and temperature<sup>1</sup>.
  * The current mass of the vehicle and the total mass<sup>1</sup> of vehicle and all its attachments and loads.
* Keybindings can be changed in the game options menu.

**<sup>1</sup> In multiplayer games, all clients, except the host, won't display the fuel usage rate, engine temperature and mass correctly due to GIANTS Engine fail**

## What this mod doesn't (fully) do
* Work on consoles. Buy a PC for proper gaming.
